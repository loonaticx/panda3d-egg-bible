    Dynamic Coordinate System (DCS)
        Indicates that show code will expect to be able to read the transform set on this
        node at run time, and may need to modify the transformation of this node further.

    Morphs
        linear interpolations of attribute values at run time, according to values read from an animation table. 

    PointLight
        Set of single points

    Patch
        similar to a polygon, but it is a special primitive that can only be rendered with the use of a tessellation shader

    Polygon
        consists of a sequence of vertices from a single vertex pool

    NURBS Curve
        general parametric curve often used to represent a motion path, e.g. for a camera or an object.

    Scalar
        Optional values that specify some attribute value relevant to the current context
