==================

.. glossary::
    Dynamic Coordinate System (DCS)
        Indicates that show code will expect to be able to read the transform set on this
        node at run time, and may need to modify the transformation of this node further.

    Morphs
        linear interpolations of attribute values at run time, according to values read from an animation table. 

    NURBS Curve
        general parametric curve often used to represent a motion path, e.g. for a camera or an object.

    Patch
        similar to a polygon, but it is a special primitive that can only be rendered with the use of a tessellation shader

    PointLight
        Set of single points

    Polygon
        Consists of a sequence of vertices from a single vertex pool

    Triangle Strip (T-Strip)
        A series of connected triangles

    Scalar
        Optional values that specify some attribute value relevant to the current context

    "Straddle" Polygon
        A type of polygon where the polygon type at the point center covers at least 90% of the point area, and the point center does not fall in an inclusion. May also be in reference to a *"Dominant Polygon"*.
